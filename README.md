# UChicagoCSWork
A collection of exercise and project code written during my time at UChicago. 

Some of the larger projects include:

 - [3D Terrain navigation](https://github.com/aranarochel/UChicagoCSWork/tree/master/CMSC-237-Introduction-to-Computer-Graphics/final-team-project) (along with more features) written in *C++* using *OpenGL*. Written for *"CMSC 237: Introduction to Computer Graphics"*
 
 - A channel ([SecureChannel](https://github.com/aranarochel/UChicagoCSWork/tree/master/CMSC-232-Introduction-to-Computer-Security/proj3)) that is secure enough for a client and server to send messages between each other, written in *Java*. Written for *"CMSC 232: Introduction to Computer Security"*.
 
 - [chirc](https://github.com/aranarochel/UChicagoCSWork/tree/master/CMSC-233-Networks-and-Distributed-Systems/chirc): an implementation of a simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server that is compliant with part of the IRC [protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812), written in *C*. This project belongs to the [UChicago χ-Projects](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html), and documentation about the project specification can be found [here](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/index.html). Written for *"CMSC 233: Networks and Distributed Systems "*
 - [chitcp](https://github.com/aranarochel/UChicagoCSWork/tree/master/CMSC-233-Networks-and-Distributed-Systems/chitcp): an implementation of a subset of the TCP [protocol](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt) in userspace, instead of having to work with kernel code. This project belongs to the [UChicago χ-Projects](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html), and documentation about the project specification can be found [here](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chitcp/index.html). Written for *“CMSC 233: Networks and Distributed Systems"*.
 
 - [chidb](https://github.com/aranarochel/UChicagoCSWork/tree/master/CMSC-235-Introduction-to-Database-Systems/chidb): a didactic relational database management system (RDBMS) designed for teaching how a RDBMS is built internally, from the data organization in files all the way up to the SQL parser and query optimizer. This project belongs to the [UChicago χ-Projects](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html), and documentation about the project specification can be found [here](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/index.html). Written for *“CMSC 235: Introduction to Database Systems"*.
