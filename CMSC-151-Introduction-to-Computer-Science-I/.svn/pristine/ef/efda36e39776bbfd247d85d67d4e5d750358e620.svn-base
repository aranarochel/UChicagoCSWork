;; ====== Data Definitions ======

;; a state-rate is a (make-state-rate abbrev pct)
;; where abbrev is a symbol
;;   and pct is a number
(define-struct state-rate (abbrev pct))

;; a (listof state-rate) is either
;; - empty, or
;; - (cons r rs) where r is a state-rate and rs is a (listof state-rate)

;; an item is a (make-item kind price quantity)
;; where kind is a symbol ('hat, 'jacket, etc.),
;;       price is a num (in dollars), and
;;       quantity is a num
(define-struct item (kind price quantity))

;; a (listof item) is either
;; - empty, or
;; - (cons i items) where i is an item, and items is a (listof item)

;; a bill is a (make-bill items items-price sales-tax s&h total)
;; where items is a (listof item),
;;       items-price is a num (in dollars),
;;       sales-tax is a num (in dollars),
;;       s&h (shipping and handling) is a num (in dollars), and
;;       total is a num (in dollars)
(define-struct bill (items items-price sales-tax s&h total))
