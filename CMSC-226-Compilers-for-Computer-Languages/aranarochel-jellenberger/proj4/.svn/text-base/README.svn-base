CMSC 22610
Winter 2015

This directory contains the seed code for Project 4.  Your code should go into
the backend directory; you should feel free to modify or add code in that
directory as you see fit (as long as the Backend module's signature does not
change).  You should not need to change any of the code in the other directories
(unless you want to use your own project 3 solution).
