\subsection*{1) Integrating a Function}
Using the recursive trapezoidal rule to within a tolerance of $\epsilon=10^{-4} $, the integral of the function is approximated as $147.413177$. To obtain this integral threshold, I had to use a value of $n=13$, which consequently meant my stepsize was $h=\frac{5}{2^{13}}\approx0.000610$.


\subsection*{2) Simpson's Method}
Using Simpson's method, and using the same stepsize value for $h$ as above, the calculated integral I obtained was $147.413159$. This estimate is actually reasonably close to the real answer
\[e^5-1 \approx 147.413159102577\ldotp \]


\subsection*{3) More Integration}
To evaluate this integral so that the fifth decimal point is unchanging, I again used the same stepsize as above with the Simpson's method. The calculated integral using this method is $3.141592$.
