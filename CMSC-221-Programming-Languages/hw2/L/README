HW2 part 1 : implement lexical scanning, parsing, scoping and
evaluating L programs. Examine the source code. Hints are sprinkled
throughout.

To compile the whole bundle by using the provided cm file (which is
SML/NJ's equivalent of a Makefile), from within the sml REPL, type
this:

- CM.make "sourcesL.cm";

It should already compile, although, as given, all the critical
functions are stubbed out with exceptions.
