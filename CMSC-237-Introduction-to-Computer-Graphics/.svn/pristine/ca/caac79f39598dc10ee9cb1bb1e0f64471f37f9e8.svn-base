You need to clear your spec_buffer each time you render in deferred mode. Since you are blending the buffer you'll 
be blending in the information from the previous time deferred mode was turned on. Also you need to disable
depth mask because it's not needed anymore (glDepthMask(GL_FALSE);) The directional light pass
only requires you to render a screen quad and not all the cones to the screen.

I would recommend not using floats as your light type due to floating point equality issues: 

 if(lightType == 1.0) {  // directional light
