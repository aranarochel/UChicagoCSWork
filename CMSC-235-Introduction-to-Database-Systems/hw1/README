The topic for this database is classical music; specifically music from the early classical period to the late romantic period. The data sources I used to populate the composers table and compositions (called 'works' in the database) table were found at Wikipedia.com and Imslp.org. For example, a table of composers from the Romantic era was found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Romantic-era_composers. A table of works by Mozart was found here: http://imslp.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.

When designing my database I tried to think about what sort of semantic objects were important to my topic how they related to one another. I essentially boiled it down into three categories: Composers, Eras, & Works. When I first created my draft of the tables, I had era as just a column header under the composers table. However, it's very often the case that composers belong to more than just one era of music such as Beethoven. As such I decided to make Eras it's own table with just two entries: Classical & Romantic, each with it's own key and start and end dates. Then I could create a join table called ComposerEras which bridged the Composers table with the Eras table. The works table is largely independant of the Eras table but it does contain a foreign key which references the composer's ID in the Composers table. Of course I could have gone and possibly created more semantic objects or more column categories in each table, but due to the data constraints I could find I limited myself to just these things.
