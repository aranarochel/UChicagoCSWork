# Test SELECT-15
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Same as SELECT-13 but with this query:
#
#   select altcode from numbers where code <= 65 order by code desc;
#
# i.e., using a key that does not exist in the table.


# This file has a B-Tree with height 3
#
# Note: This file also has an index on column "altcode",
#       but we are not using it.
