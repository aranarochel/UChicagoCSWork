# Test SELECT-13
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Same as SELECT-13 but with this query:
#
#   select altcode from numbers where code < 60 order by code desc;
#
# (i.e., less than instead of less than or equal)

# This file has a B-Tree with height 3
#
# Note: This file also has an index on column "altcode",
#       but we are not using it.
