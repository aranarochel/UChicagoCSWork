# Test INDEX-3
#
# Assuming this table and index:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#   CREATE INDEX idxNumbers ON numbers(altcode);
#
# Run the equivalent of this SQL query:
#
#   select textcode from numbers where altcode = 7266;
#
# So, the same as INDEX-1, but with altcode not being unique, which means we need
# to seek *and* iterate over the index. chidb actually only supports unique indices,
# so the above query will still only return at most one row. However, the
# DBM program in this test is closer to the code that SQLite generates.
#

# This file has a Table B-Tree with height 3 (rooted at page 2)
# as well as an Index B-Tree (on column "altcode" of the 'numbers'
# table), rooted at page 163.
