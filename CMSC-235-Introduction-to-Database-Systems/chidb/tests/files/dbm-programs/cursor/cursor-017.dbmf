# Test CURSOR-17
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Position the cursor on the cell with code == 9985 (the file does contain an entry 
# with code = 9985 in the righmost node of the tree) and then iterate backwards with Prev.
#
# This requires that Prev be capable of iterating across pages.
#
# Note that this test doesn't check whether the cursor is pointing
# to valid values or whether it is hitting the right number of entries.
# Use the sql-select tests for that (basically, you should make sure that
# this test doesn't crash or loop indefinitely before you move on to the 
# tests in sql-select) 

# This file has a B-Tree with height 3
USE 1table-largebtree.cdb
