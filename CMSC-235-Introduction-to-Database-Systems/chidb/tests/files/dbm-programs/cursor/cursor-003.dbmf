# Test CURSOR-3
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE courses(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, prof BYTE, dept INTEGER);
#
# Use a cursor to iterate through every row of the table.
#
# Note that this test doesn't check whether the cursor is pointing
# to valid values, or even whether it hits all the rows in the table.
# Use the sql-select tests for that (basically, you should make sure that
# the cursor tests don't crash or loop indefinitely before you move on 
# to the tests in sql-select) 

# This file has a 1-page table, which allows us
# to test cursors without navigating the tree
# structure.
