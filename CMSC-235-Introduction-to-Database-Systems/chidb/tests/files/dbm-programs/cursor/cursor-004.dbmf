# Test CURSOR-4
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Use a cursor to iterate through every row of the table.
#
# Note that this test doesn't check whether the cursor is pointing
# to valid values, or even whether it hits all the rows in the table.
# Use the sql-select tests for that (basically, you should make sure that
# this test doesn't crash or loop indefinitely before you move on to the 
# tests in sql-select) 

# This file has a B-Tree with height 3, which requires
# implementing a cursor capable of iterating over
# the cells of the tree in sequence.
