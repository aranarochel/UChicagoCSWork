# Test CURSOR-11
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Same as CURSOR-7 but iterating over all cells with code >= 10000 (i.e., searching 
# for a key such that there are no keys). SeekGe should skip the instruction that sets
# R_2 to 42.
