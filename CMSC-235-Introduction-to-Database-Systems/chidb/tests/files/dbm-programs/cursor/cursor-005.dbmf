# Test CURSOR-5
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Position the cursor on the cell with code == 9985 (the file does contain an entry 
# with code = 9985).  
#
# Note that this test doesn't check whether the cursor is pointing
# to valid values, but it will check whether Seek claims to have found
# the cell or not. If the Seek is successful, R_2 will be set to 42. Otherwise,
# it will be 0. 

# This file has a B-Tree with height 3
USE 1table-largebtree.cdb
