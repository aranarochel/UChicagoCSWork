# Test CURSOR-13
#
# Assuming this table:
#
#   CREATE TABLE numbers(code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, textcode TEXT, altcode INTEGER);
#
# Iterate, in reverse order, over all the cells with code <= 60 
# (using SeekLe to position the cursor)
#
# Note that this test doesn't check whether the cursor is pointing
# to valid values, or even whether the cursor is hitting the right
# number of cells. It will, however, fail if the cursor cannot
# find any entries with code <= 60 (which it should). If R_2 is set to 42,
# it means at least one such entry was found. If set to 0, SeekLe didn't
# find any cells.
