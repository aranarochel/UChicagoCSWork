/*
 *  chiTCP - A simple, testable TCP stack
 *
 *  A circular buffer data structure
 *
 *  This module provides a circular buffer data structure used for
 *  the TCP send and receive buffers. This buffer has the following
 *  characteristics:
 *
 *  - When the buffer is created, it is created with a specific
 *    capacity, and that capacity cannot be extended later on.
 *
 *  - The buffer is used to store a stream of bytes, with a known
 *    initial sequence number. For example, if the initial sequence
 *    number is 23300, the 0th position of the buffer contains
 *    byte 23300, the 1st position contains byte 23301, the 2nd
 *    position contains 23302, etc.
 *
 *    This also means that data is written at the end of the
 *    stream of bytes, and read from the start of the stream.
 *    For example, imagine we have an 8-byte buffer, and that the
 *    initial sequence number is 23300. The empty buffer would
 *    look like this:
 *
 *      0 : [   ]
 *      1 : [   ]
 *      2 : [   ]
 *      3 : [   ]
 *      4 : [   ]
 *      5 : [   ]
 *      6 : [   ]
 *      7 : [   ]
 *
 *    Now lets say we write three bytes (starting at sequence number
 *    23300):
 *
 *      0 : [ Byte 23300 ]
 *      1 : [ Byte 23301 ]
 *      2 : [ Byte 23302 ]
 *      3 : [   ]
 *      4 : [   ]
 *      5 : [   ]
 *      6 : [   ]
 *      7 : [   ]
 *
 *    And then write a further three bytes:
 *
 *      0 : [ Byte 23300 ]
 *      1 : [ Byte 23301 ]
 *      2 : [ Byte 23302 ]
 *      3 : [ Byte 23303 ]
 *      4 : [ Byte 23304 ]
 *      5 : [ Byte 23305 ]
 *      6 : [   ]
 *      7 : [   ]
 *
 *    So, data is always written after the *last* byte written
 *    to the buffer. You cannot write to arbitrary positions of the buffer.
 *
 *    Similarly, you cannot read arbitrary positions of the buffer;
 *    instead, reading from the buffer is always done from start
 *    of the stream of bytes. So, if we read four bytes from the buffer,
 *    we would extract Bytes 23300-23303 from the buffer, which would
 *    be left in this state:
 *
 *      0 : [   ]
 *      1 : [   ]
 *      2 : [   ]
 *      3 : [   ]
 *      4 : [ Byte 23304 ]
 *      5 : [ Byte 23305 ]
 *      6 : [   ]
 *      7 : [   ]
 *
 *
 *  - It is a circular buffer, with the end of the buffer connecting to
 *    the start of the buffer. If we wrote four bytes to the above buffer,
 *    we would have this:
 *
 *      0 : [ Byte 23308 ]
 *      1 : [ Byte 23309 ]
 *      2 : [   ]
 *      3 : [   ]
 *      4 : [ Byte 23304 ]
 *      5 : [ Byte 23305 ]
 *      6 : [ Byte 23306 ]
 *      7 : [ Byte 23307 ]
 *
 *    Note that this wrapping around doesn't mean you can overwrite data
 *    at the start of the data stream. In the above buffer, you would only
 *    be able to write an additional two bytes.
 *
 *  - It is a blocking buffer. If you want to write N bytes to the buffer
 *    (assuming that N is less than or equal to the maximum capacity of
 *    the buffer), the call to circular_buffer_write will block until
 *    it is possible to write all the data to the buffer. For example,
 *    if we wanted to write four bytes to the above buffer, we would
 *    block until (at least) bytes 23304 and 23305 had been read from
 *    the buffer.
 *
 *    Similarly, reading on an empty buffer will block until there is
 *    data to read from the buffer.
